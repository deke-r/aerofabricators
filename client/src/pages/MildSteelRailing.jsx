      secondaryDescription={`Mild steel (especially), galvanized steel, and aluminium are likely to be unpainted, and more modern-looking railings, especially anything with glass panels will probably be stainless. Mild steel generally has a fairly bright silvery satin finish which feels smooth and hard to the touch. Aluminum is smooth but a dullish silver while galvanized steel is a matte dull grey (unless it is very new) and often shows a visible large crystal grain structure on the surface. Mild steel is galvanized steel that can be easily scratched to show a much brighter silvery-white surface underneath.<br/><br/><br/>Mild steel is low-maintenance steel and is durable. It is very easy to clean thatâ€™s the only reason we want our clients to use it. Because our work for metal resists tarnished and brushes and polishes can be used to maintain their perfect appearance. Dent, scratch, and damage are difficult to achieve due to the steel's treated nature. Steel can be coated with paint or sprayed with a coating to increase its durability.<br/><br/><br/><strong>We set new Standards in quality and design for MS Railing manufacturing</strong><br/><br/><br/>We are mild steel railing manufacturers in Noida and Delhi NCR.
